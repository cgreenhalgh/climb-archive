- Vignette C: Repeat Disklavier Code – Premiere Dress Rehearsal. Angry Deer (code played at 12sec) You can see the score highlighting second time she plays it. 
- Vignette D: Musical interpretation avoids clashes: Anne Veinberg, The Stones, pretty much from start
- Vignette E Choosing to fail by improvising off the score - Anne Veinberg, Herd Of Cows ~ 49sec (misses out the second note of the code phrase)
- Vignette F: 
- Vignette G: System issues - Compare the tempo Anne Veinberg’s on Echo to another version
